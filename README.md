# User Story
## Title - Task Assignment Module

## Pre-requisite:
1. The user must have an existing account with appropriate permissions to assign tasks.
2. The system should be able to display the available subjects and task types.

## Description:
**WHO?** As a team leader (USER). **WHAT?** I (USER) want to use the task assignment module to assign tasks to students and **WHY?** monitor their (EMPLOYEES / STUDENTS) progress.

## Details:
1. A dropdown menu for Task Subject selection.
2. A textbox for entering Task Name.
3. A textbox for entering Completion Date and Time.
4. A dropdown menu for selecting Task Type.
5. A checkbox option to set Reminder.
6. A save button to confirm task assignment.
7. A cancel button to discard any entered information and exit the task assignment process.
8. A list of assigned tasks with columns for Task Subject, Task Name, Day & Time, Task Type, and options to edit or delete assignments.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. The title **"Task Assignment Module -"** should be prominently displayed at the top of the interface.
2. A dropdown menu labeled **"Task Subject"** allows users to select the subject of the task from a predefined list or enter a custom subject.
3. A textbox labeled **"Task Name"** where users can input the name of the assigned task, with validation checks for entry format and mandatory field completion.
4. A textbox labeled **"Completion Date and Time"** where users can input the deadline date and time for the task, with validation checks for entry format and mandatory field completion.
5. A dropdown menu labeled **"Task Type"** where users can select the type of task from a predefined list or enter a custom type, aiding in categorization and prioritization of tasks.
6. A checkbox option labeled **“Set Reminder”** that when selected, activates reminder notifications as per set preferences before the deadline approaches.
7. A save button labeled **"Save"** that when clicked, saves all entered information in the database, confirms task assignment, and shows a success message to the user.
8. A cancel button labeled **"Cancel"** that when clicked, discards all entered information, exits the user from the current operation, and returns them back without saving any changes.
9. A list labeled **"List"** that displays all assigned tasks in a tabular format, with columns for Task Subject, Task Name, Day & Time, Task Type, Status of the Task (ASSIGNED OR UNASSIGNED), and options to edit or delete assignments.
10. An edit option labeled **"Edit"** that allows users to modify the details of an existing task and save the changes.
11. A delete option labeled **"Delete"** that allows users to remove an existing task from the list and the database, and shows a confirmation message to the user.

## Action Result:
1. Clicking the **"Save"** button for a task should save all entered data into the database, confirm task assignment, and show a success message to the user.
2. Clicking the **"Cancel"** button for a task should discard all entered data, exit the user from the current operation, and return them back without making any changes or saving information.
3. Clicking the **"Edit"** option for a task should allow the user to modify the details of the task and save the changes.
4. Clicking the **"Delete"** option for a task should remove the task from the list and the database, and show a confirmation message to the user.
